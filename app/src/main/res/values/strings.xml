        \n\nI love making fire with my magic wand. I am a fire wizard after all!
        \n\nI fought the Balgrog of Ugul from the core of the earth to the top of the earth. After
        that I went to get a healthy breakfast at my favorite restaurant. I did fight the Balrog for
        several days that felt like several weeks so I was obviously starving. I hear the Hobbits
        have tasty breakfasts.
        \n\nThen a Hobbit came to me and said: \"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. The
        quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. The
        quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.\"
